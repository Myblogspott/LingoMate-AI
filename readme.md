### Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues**: Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with your OS.
- **Virtual Environment Activation**: Double-check that your virtual environment is activated before installing dependencies or running the Python server.
- **Mac M1/M2 Users**: If using `brew`, ensure your installed packages are configured for your chip architecture.
